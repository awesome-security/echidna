# NODE <-> SERVER

SERVER Listens....

NODE Connects...
IF Connect (OK); NODE SENDS: METHOD,MODULE,PROTOCOL:
   "AUTH CXTRACKER NSMF/1.0\n"

SERVER RESPONDS IF IT SUPPORTS/NOT SUPPORTS METHOD,MODULE,PROTOCOL:
   200 OK ACCEPTED                  (ALL OK)
   201 METHOD NOT SUPPORTED         (Else reply the first error it sees)
   202 MODULE NOT SUPPORTED         ....
   203 PROTOCOL NOT SUPPORTED       ....
   210 UNKNOWN ERROR                (When its an unknown error)

If SERVER sends "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
    NODE sends ID
        ID string is: "ID KEY NODENAME NETGROUP\n"
SERVER sends "200 OK ACCEPTED\n" if ID is OK (bruteforce problem)

From here, SERVER or NODE can send PING,PONG,POST,GET,BYE

*POST:**** ( The node normally sends $DATA to the server, SNORT events etc.
NODE sends       : "POST DATA\n"
SERVER acks      : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
NODE sends data  : "$DATA\n.\r\n"  (NODE ends communication with a single line containing  ".\r\n")
                    $DATA is handled by the spesific MODULE on the SERVER
SERVER acks      : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
or SERVER fail   : "204 DATA RECIEVE ERROR\n"


*PING/PONG:**** (Just say hello - im alive)
NODE/SERVER sends: "PING $DATE\n"
SERVER/NODE sends: "PONG $DATE\n"


*GET:**** (Example, Server requests full cxtracker sessiondata or daemonlogger pcap data)
SERVER sends     : "GET $MODULE\n"
NODE sends       : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
SERVER sends     : "$DATA\n.\r\n"  (SERVER ends communication with a single line containing  ".\r\n")
                    $DATA is handled by the spesific MODULE on the NODE
NODE sends       : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
or NODE fail     : "204 DATA RECIEVE ERROR\n"


*BYE:**** (Im shuting down - bye message)
NODE/SERVER sends: "BYE\n"
SERVER/NODE sends: "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
SERVER/NODE closes the connection


# CLIENT <-> SERVER

SERVER Listens.... (not on same port as for NODES?)

CLIENT Connects...
IF Connect (OK); CLIENT SENDS: METHOD,MODULE,PROTOCOL:
   "AUTH CLIENT NSMF/1.0\n"
If SERVER sends "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
    CLIENT sends UID
            ID string is: "UID USERNAME PASSWORD\n"
SERVER sends "200 OK ACCEPTED\n" if UID is OK (bruteforce problem)

From here, SERVER or CLIENT can send PING,PONG,POST,GET,BYE

GET:**** ( The CLIENT asks for $DATA from the server, SEARCH queuery etc. for flow sessions)
CLIENT sends     : "GET CXTRACKER\n"
SERVER acks      : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
CLIENT sends data: "$DATA\n.\r\n"  (NODE ends communication with a single line containing  ".\r\n")
                    $DATA is handled by the spesific MODULE on the SERVER
                    $DATA here is the query for sesssion
SERVER acks      : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
or SERVER fail   : "204 DATA RECIEVE ERROR\n"

SERVER responds with POST when the data is ready:
SERVER sends     : "POST $MODULE\n"
CLIENT sends     : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
SERVER sends     : "$DATA\n.\r\n"  (SERVER ends communication with a single line containing  ".\r\n")
                    $DATA is handled by the spesific MODULE on the CLIENT (which sent the request)
CLIENT sends     : "200 OK ACCEPTED\n"
or CLIENT fail   : "204 DATA RECIEVE ERROR\n"
