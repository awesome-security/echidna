# CLIENT <-> SERVER

SERVER Listens....

CLIENT Connects...
IF Connect (OK); CLIENT SENDS: METHOD,MODULE,PROTOCOL:
   POST CXTRACKER NSMF/1.0\r\n\r\n

SERVER RESPONDS IF IT SUPPORTS/NOT SUPPORTS METHOD,MODULE,PROTOCOL:
   200 OK ACCEPTED                  (ALL OK)
   201 METHOD NOT SUPPORTED         (Else reply the first error it sees)
   202 MODULE NOT SUPPORTED         ....
   203 PROTOCOL NOT SUPPORTED       ....
   210 UNKNOWN ERROR                (When its an unknown error

CLIENT SENDS ID IF SERVER SENDS "200 OK ACCEPTED"
   ID STRING IS: ID KEY NODENAME NETGROUP
CLIENT SENDS DATA IF SERVER SENDS "200 OK ACCEPTED"
CLIENT ENDS COMMUNICAION with a line containing only a periode "." ?

(DO WE NEED TO SEND REPLY FROM SERVER??? 300 OK PROCCESSED, 310 ERROR PROCCESSING?)

CLIENT/SERVER CLOSE CONNECTIONS

From this time on, the SERVER is responsable for the DATA. So if it for some
reasesons cant process it, and the SERVER dies, the data will be lost :/
(Or might be stored in a tmp-file, process, then delete file if OK, or move
to failed dir if ERROR).
